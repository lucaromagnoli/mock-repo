# Story: Basic Application Layout

**Story ID:** story-001
**Feature:** [Simple UI](../../feature.md)
**Priority:** Must Have
**Status:** Not Started
**Created:** 2026-02-10

## User Story
As a user, I want to see a clean and organized application layout, so that I can easily navigate and interact with the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Application displays a consistent header/navigation area at the top of every page
2. Content area is clearly defined and properly spaced from navigation elements
3. Layout is responsive and adapts appropriately to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
4. All text is readable with sufficient contrast against background colors
5. Application renders without horizontal scrolling on standard viewport sizes

## Definition of Done
- User can access the application and see a professionally organized layout
- Layout works correctly on desktop (1920x1080), tablet (768x1024), and mobile (375x667) viewports
- All acceptance criteria are met and verified through manual testing

## User Value
Provides users with a professional, organized interface that establishes trust and makes the application intuitive to use. A well-structured layout reduces cognitive load and helps users focus on their tasks rather than figuring out how to navigate the interface.

## Notes
- Consider using a standard layout pattern (e.g., header + content, or header + sidebar + content)
- Ensure adequate whitespace to prevent visual clutter
- Layout should accommodate future feature additions without requiring major restructuring
- Consider accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum) for color contrast and text sizing
