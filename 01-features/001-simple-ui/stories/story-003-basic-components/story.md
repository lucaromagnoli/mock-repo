# Story: Basic UI Components

**Story ID:** story-003
**Feature:** [Simple UI](../../feature.md)
**Priority:** Should Have
**Status:** Not Started
**Created:** 2026-02-10

## User Story
As a user, I want to interact with consistent, well-designed UI components, so that I have a predictable and pleasant experience throughout the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Buttons have consistent styling, clear labels, and provide visual feedback (hover, active, disabled states)
2. Input fields have clear labels, placeholder text where appropriate, and visible focus indicators
3. All interactive components respond to both mouse and keyboard interactions
4. Error states are clearly communicated with appropriate colors and messaging
5. Components maintain visual consistency with the overall application design (colors, spacing, typography)

## Definition of Done
- Users can interact with buttons and input fields intuitively
- All component states (normal, hover, focus, active, disabled, error) are visually distinct
- Components work correctly with keyboard navigation
- Visual consistency is maintained across all components
- All acceptance criteria are met and verified

## User Value
Provides users with a professional, polished interface that feels cohesive and reliable. Consistent UI components reduce the learning curve and build user confidence, as they know what to expect when interacting with different parts of the application.

## Notes
- Focus on core components: buttons (primary, secondary, tertiary), input fields (text, number, etc.), and basic feedback elements
- Consider establishing a simple design system or component library for consistency
- All components should follow accessibility best practices (ARIA labels, keyboard support, focus management)
- Error messages should be actionable and helpful, not just indicate failure
- Consider loading states for asynchronous actions
