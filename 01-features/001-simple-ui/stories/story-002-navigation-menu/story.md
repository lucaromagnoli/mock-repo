**Priority:** Must Have
**Status:** Completed
**Completed:** 2026-02-10

## User Story
As a user, I want to access a navigation menu, so that I can easily move between different sections of the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Navigation menu displays all primary application sections with clear, descriptive labels
2. Current/active page is visually highlighted in the navigation menu
3. All navigation links are clickable and navigate to the correct destination
4. Menu is accessible via keyboard navigation (Tab key to focus, Enter to activate)
5. On mobile devices, navigation collapses into a hamburger menu that can be opened and closed

## Definition of Done
- Users can navigate to all main sections of the application using the menu
- Active page indication works correctly on all pages
- Keyboard navigation functions properly for accessibility
- Mobile menu interaction works smoothly without layout issues
- All acceptance criteria are met and verified

## User Value
Enables users to efficiently explore and access different parts of the application without confusion. Good navigation is fundamental to user experience and reduces frustration by making the application's structure clear and predictable.

## Notes
- Consider using standard navigation patterns (horizontal top nav for desktop, hamburger menu for mobile)
- Navigation should be persistent across all pages for consistency
- Menu items should support future expansion (new sections can be added easily)
- Consider including visual feedback on hover for desktop users
- Mobile menu should not interfere with content when open (overlay or push pattern)
