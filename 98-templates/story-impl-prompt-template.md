Please read the story at ${STORY_DIR}/story.md and implement all tasks in the tasks/ directory.
The implementation should be in ${CODE}/ (project root).

Before implementing, read the existing project structure to understand where files should be placed (e.g., src/, lib/, tests/, etc.). Follow the established patterns and directory organization.

Identify task dependencies and implement in the correct order.

**NOTE ON PR FEEDBACK:** If this prompt includes a "PR Review: Code-Level Fixes" section below, apply those fixes during implementation:
- Incorporate code-level improvements as you write the implementation
- Address style, error handling, validation, and other code quality issues mentioned
- Ensure the implementation reflects both the task requirements AND the PR feedback

IMPORTANT: After successfully implementing all tasks, commit your changes to task files AND implementation.
IMPORTANT: Do not re-initialize the git repository when commiting your work
IMPORTANT: If you have a permissions issue, fail immediately
IMPORTANT: Place any assumptions made during the implementation in ${STORY_DIR}/tasks/assumptions.md
